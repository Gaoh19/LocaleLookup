# LocaleLookup - Information Retreival Website

Here’s a writeup on how to create a search engine sort off full stack web application that finds local businesses or institutions using PERN stack, I know everyone is running behind MERN now, but I love PostgreSQL. 
If you aren’t familiar with PERN, here’s what it stands for, P for PostgreSQL, E for Express.js , R for React and N for Node.js.
Now I got no idea on how the end product would look like, but I’m going for something along the Yelp example. Maybe adding Map API at the end would be an icing in the cake. **[Redacted]**

### P.S. Here's what ChatGPT wrote,
The outlined project aims to develop a comprehensive web application utilizing the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to facilitate the retrieval of information regarding local businesses or institutions, 
inspired by platforms like Yelp. Emphasizing a preference for PostgreSQL over MongoDB, the project seeks to leverage the robust capabilities of relational databases for data management. The envisioned application will feature 
a user-friendly interface, enabling users to conduct searches for local establishments seamlessly. Furthermore, integration of map functionalities, potentially through APIs like Google Maps or Mapbox, will enhance the user experience 
by providing interactive location-based insights. For further details, please refer to the provided Notion link.
